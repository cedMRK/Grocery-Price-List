<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software solutions based on mobile platforms have grown extremely popular in today's technological world and are employed in a wide variety of world disciplines. Not only have mobile applications become a way of life, but technology in general is expanding and exhibiting the promising ability to meet the majority of human technological needs in a complete manner.</p>

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimarket cost list mobile application provides the owner with a list of item prices that they are selling. The mobile web applications are easily accessible and simple to use. The project essentially describes how to maintain continuous performance and give better services to clients and sellers. This application saves the employee time and effort to find the cost price of a specific item. With the log in security, the users can secure their data that they store in the app. This application may change the amount of the product, search for it, and encode it. 
  The project's purpose is to improve the application's dependability, simplicity, speed, and information. They can even edit the list, delete the items, and apply more changes that will reflect instantly. Furthermore, they can reassign the products to distinct and respective categories or create customized categories as per they need.</p>

<h3>Requirement</h3>
<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first critical phase is to establish the essential requirements for designing and developing a system. Important information and needs, such as what the clients desire in the system, are gathered in this phase</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This phase of project management in which the team visualized the system's primary features, structures, and significant deliverables. The system's modules and interfaces were initially built by the researchers based on the demands and duties of the user in the process. The process of creating modules and interfaces were measured by analysis of needs and design of the system based on the roles and tasks of the user.</p>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout this phase, the application is built and coded by the team using automation tools to convert process and data models into actual prototypes. This phase includes methods like coding, user interface design, and database design. The researchers utilize different kinds of tools in the development of the system's prototype.</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the testing, the application will have its reliability and development to be able to meet the objectives and user satisfaction.</p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team will examine reviews and any concerns that may surface when operating the program. Dedicated to continuous improvement, support, and dependability for the application's success.</p>
